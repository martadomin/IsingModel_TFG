# IsingModel_TFG

Here you can find the code I developed for my Bachelor's thesis "Ising Model in a Quantum Computer" using python. If you run this code you get the Magnetitzation of the Ground state of the Ising Model for different values for the polarization field $(\lambda)$:

$H = \sum_{j}{\sigma_{j}^{x}\sigma_{j+1}^{x}} + \lambda \sum_{j}{\sigma_{j}^{z}}$

To run this code you need to have qiskit updated to version 1.1 and an IBM Quantum Platform account to run it on one of their Quantum Machines.
